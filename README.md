## Quick Installation Guide

Get started with the Storacha MCP Storage Server in just a few simple steps.

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/storacha/mcp-storage-server.git && cd mcp-storage-server
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Generate Keys & Delegation**

   - **Install the CLI**
     ```bash
     npm install -g @web3-storage/w3cli
     ```
   - **Login to Storacha**
     ```bash
     w3 login
     ```
     _Output:_
     ```
     ? How do you want to login?
       Via Email
     ‚ùØ Via GitHub
     ```
     _Select **Via GitHub** and authenticate with your GitHub account._
   - **Create a Space**
     ```bash
     w3 space create <your_space_name>
     ```
     _Replace `<your_space_name>` with a name for your new Space_. :warning: _Make sure you save the recovery key, so you can access your space from another device if needed._
   - **Create a Private Key**

     ```bash
     w3 key create
     ```

     _Output:_

     ```txt
     AgentId: did:key:z6MkhMZRW2aoJ6BQwkpMSJu68Jgqkz1FTpr1p69cpnN43YWG
     PrivateKey: LMgCYLkvOc8Sm0mOL4cWFLxsWP0ZPEYrLxcQqsV93/s5RLje0BKx05muAse1Hkvh+sxUW38OcHtpiN1zxfpTJ4ht4jxV0=
     ```

   - **Set the Agent ID & Create Delegation**
     ```bash
     w3 delegation create <agent_id> \
      --can 'store/add' \
      --can 'filecoin/offer' \
      --can 'upload/add' \
      --can 'space/blob/add' \
      --can 'space/index/add' --base64
     ```
     _Replace <agent_id> with the AgentId from the previous step. It grants the Agent the permission to store files into the recently created space_.

4. **Configure the MCP Client**

   Next, configure your MCP client (such as Cursor) to use this server. Most MCP clients store the configuration as JSON in the following format:

   ```jsonc
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "storacha-storage-server": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["./dist/index.js"],
         "env": {
           // The server supports `stdio`, `sse`, and `rest` modes, the default is `stdio`.
           "MCP_TRANSPORT_MODE": "stdio",
           // The Storacha Agent private key that is authorized to store data into the Space.
           "PRIVATE_KEY": "<agent_private_key>",
           // The base64 encoded delegation that proves the Agent is allowed to store data. If not set, MUST be provided for each upload request.
           "DELEGATION": "<base64_delegation>",
         },
         "shell": true,
         "cwd": "./",
       },
     },
   }
   ```

   _Replace `<agent_private_key>` with the PrivateKey you created in step 3. Then, replace the `<base64_delegation>` with the delegation you created in step 3._

   ### REST Mode and Cloud Hosting

   The Storacha MCP Storage Server supports REST transport mode, which is compatible with MCP.so cloud hosting. To use REST mode:

   ```jsonc
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "storacha-storage-server-rest": {
         "url": "http://localhost:3001/rest",
       },
     },
   }
   ```

   For more information on deploying to MCP.so cloud, see the [integrations.md](https://github.com/storacha/mcp-storage-server/blob/main/docs/integrations.md#mcpso-cloud-hosting) guide.

   _:warning: There are several ways to configure MCP clients, please read the [integrations.md](https://github.com/storacha/mcp-storage-server/blob/main/docs/integrations.md) guide for more information._

## Tools

The Storacha MCP Storage Server provides the following tools for AI systems to interact with a decentralized storage network.

### Storage Operations

#### upload

Upload a file to the Storacha Network. The file must be provided as a base64 encoded string with a filename that includes the extension for MIME type detection.

```typescript
interface UploadParams {
  // Base64 encoded file content
  file: string;
  // Filename with extension for MIME type detection
  name: string;
  // Optional: Whether to publish to Filecoin (default: false)
  publishToFilecoin?: boolean;
  // Optional: Custom delegation proof
  delegation?: string;
  // Optional: Custom gateway URL
  gatewayUrl?: string;
}
```

#### retrieve

Retrieve a file from the Storacha Network. Supported filepath formats: `CID/filename`, `/ipfs/CID/filename`, or `ipfs://CID/filename`.

```typescript
interface RetrieveParams {
  // Path in format: CID/filename, /ipfs/CID/filename, or ipfs://CID/filename
  filepath: string;
  // Optional: Whether to use multiformat base64 encoding
  useMultiformatBase64?: boolean;
}
```

#### identity

Returns the `DIDKey` of the Storacha Agent loaded from the private key storage configuration.

```typescript
interface IdentityParams {
  // No parameters required
}
```
